This workspace contains a React frontend (Vite + TypeScript) and a Python Flask backend for editing an Excel-based redirect library. The backend exposes REST API endpoints for CRUD operations on Request URL - Redirect URL pairs. The frontend should consume these endpoints and provide a user-friendly interface for internal users to manage the redirect library with error checking and validation.
